# Implementation decisions

## 2026-09-18 — One hosted database

The owner explicitly chose one Supabase database for this small company, superseding the separate staging-database recommendation in PRD v2.2 and Build Specification v1.1. Keep those source documents unchanged as historical reference; this decision governs the implementation.

- GitHub: `mattdannadev/Salad-Soulmates`, initial branch `main`, both confirmed by the owner.
- Supabase: **Salad Soulmates**, organization **Danna Lab**, project `ddpfmzssgxkvvfkpcvuv`.
- Use this project for the application. Do not create a second hosted staging database.
- Automated database tests run in disposable local PostgreSQL through PGlite; tests never write to the hosted database.
- Keep schema changes in versioned `supabase/migrations` files and apply transactionally.
- Do not load sample orders, ingredient balances, or fake operating records into the shared database.
- The single-database decision does not enable receiving, production consumption, packaging, or shipping before their acceptance gates.
- Auth roles and organization/facility isolation remain enforced. No database password or privileged service key belongs in the browser or Git repository.

## Reference precedence

Current explicit owner instructions > this decision log > Build Specification v1.1 > PRD v2.2 > illustrative mockup values. Scheduling/PTO and Spanish worker mobile remain committed Increment 1A scope despite a leftover PRD sentence calling scheduling a later slice.
